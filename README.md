# ML-Classifiers

## Digit Recognizer
<p> MNIST Dataset classifier build using basic sequential CNN model from Keras </p>

### Code Requirements
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

### Python  Implementation

1) Dataset- MNIST dataset
2) Images of size 28 X 28
3) Classify clothes :         
		    0: '0',
        1: '1',
        2: '2',
        3: '3',
        4: '4',
        5: '5',
        6: '6',
        7: '7',
        8: '8',
        9: '9'

### Execution
To run the code, Launch Jupyter Notebook in the same folder as the file. 



## Cloths Recognizer 
<p> Fashion-MNIST Dataset Classifier build using tf.keras module in Tensorflow <p>

### Code Requirements
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

### Python  Implementation

1) Dataset- fashion MNIST dataset
2) Images of size 28 X 28
3) Classify clothes :         
		    0: 'T - shirt / top',
        1: 'Trouser',
        2: 'Pullover',
        3: 'Dress',
        4: 'Coat',
        5: 'Sandal',
        6: 'Shirt',
        7: 'Sneaker',
        8: 'Bag',
        9: 'Ankleboot'

### Execution
To run the code, Launch Jupyter Notebook in the same folder as the file.
